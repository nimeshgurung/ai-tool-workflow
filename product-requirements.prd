Project Overview: AI Workflow Builder for Non-Technical Users

The primary goal of this project is to develop a user-friendly workflow automation system that empowers non-technical users to visually design and manage automated processes. Users will be able to drag and drop AI tools to create powerful workflows without any coding knowledge.

Key Features:
‚Ä¢ Visual drag-and-drop interface for building workflows
‚Ä¢ Library of pre-built AI tools and integrations
‚Ä¢ Automated execution of user-created workflows
‚Ä¢ Simple, intuitive design that requires no technical expertise

The core aim is to make powerful AI automation accessible to everyone through an intuitive visual interface.
